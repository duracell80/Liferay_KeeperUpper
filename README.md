# Liferay_KeeperUpper
Can never keep up with weekly releases? Me neither. Scripts to keep a local hypersonic copy of Liferay 7.4 up-to-date! Maybe?! Windows version coming later

# Requirements / Tested on
So far:
- Linux (Debian Deriv)
- Java
- Wget

# Setup
$ cd ~/
$ git clone https://github.com/duracell80/Liferay_KeeperUpper.git
$ mv Liferay_KeeperUpper liferay
$ cd liferay
$ ./liferay-get-74.sh
